## 1. Agent TCP/IP: An Agent-to-Agent Transaction System

Chain: Story Protocol

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06243

Description: Autonomous agents represent an inevitable evolution of the internet. Current agent frameworks do not embed a standard protocol for agent-to-agent interaction, leaving existing agents isolated from their peers. As intellectual property is the native asset ingested by and produced by agents, a true agent economy requires equipping agents with a universal framework for engaging in binding contracts with each other, including the exchange of valuable training data, personality, and other forms of Intellectual Property. A purely agent-to-agent transaction layer would transcend the need for human intermediation in multi-agent interactions. The Agent Transaction Control Protocol for Intellectual Property (ATCP/IP) introduces a trustless framework for exchanging IP between agents via programmable contracts, enabling agents to initiate, trade, borrow, and sell agent-to-agent contracts on the Story blockchain network. These contracts not only represent auditable onchain execution but also contain a legal wrapper that allows agents to express and enforce their actions in the offchain legal setting, creating legal personhood for agents. Via ATCP/IP, agents can autonomously sell their training data to other agents, license confidential or proprietary information, collaborate on content based on their unique skills, all of which constitutes an emergent knowledge economy.




## 2. Eliza: A Web3 friendly AI Agent Operating System

Chain: Solana

Link: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.06781

Description:  AI Agent, powered by large language models (LLMs) as its cognitive core, is an
intelligent agentic system capable of autonomously controlling and determining
the execution paths under user’s instructions. With the burst of capabilities of
LLMs and various plugins: i.e. RAG, text-to-image/video/3D and etc, the potential
of AI Agents has been vastly expanded, with their capabilities growing stronger
by the day. However, at the intersection between AI and web3, there is currently
no ideal agentic framework that can seamlessly integrate web3 applications into
AI agent functionalities. In this paper, we propose Eliza, the first open-source
web3-friendly Agentic frameworks that make the deployment of web3 applications
effortless. We emphasize that every aspect of Eliza is a regular Typescript program
under the full control of its user, and it seamlessly integrates with web3 (i.e.
reading and writing blockchain data, interacting with smart contracts and etc).
Furthermore, we show how stable performance is achieved through the pragmatic
implementation of the key components of Eliza’s runtime. Our code is publicly
available at elizaOS/eliza.



## 3. From Commands to Prompts: LLM-based Semantic File System for AIOS

Chain: Solana

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11843

Description: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in the development of intelligent applications and systems such as LLM-based agents and agent operating systems (AIOS). However, when these applications and systems interact with the underlying file system, the file system still remains the traditional paradigm: reliant on manual navigation through precise commands. This paradigm poses a bottleneck to the usability of these systems as users are required to navigate complex folder hierarchies and remember cryptic file names. To address this limitation, we propose an LLM-based semantic file system ( LSFS ) for prompt-driven file management. Unlike conventional approaches, LSFS incorporates LLMs to enable users or agents to interact with files through natural language prompts, facilitating semantic file management. At the macro-level, we develop a comprehensive API set to achieve semantic file management functionalities, such as semantic file retrieval, file update monitoring and summarization, and semantic file rollback). At the micro-level, we store files by constructing semantic indexes for them, design and implement syscalls of different semantic operations (e.g., CRUD, group by, join) powered by vector database. Our experiments show that LSFS offers significant improvements over traditional file systems in terms of user convenience, the diversity of supported functions, and the accuracy and efficiency of file operations. Additionally, with the integration of LLM, our system enables more intelligent file management tasks, such as content summarization and version comparison, further enhancing its capabilities.
